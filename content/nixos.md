Nix: the language, the package manager, the operating system.

I have tried to dive into Nix before, and I gave up.

As of September 2024, I have tried once more and I think it's going to stick.

It's strange, there are no tangible benefits for me to switch to Nix, its a decision driven solely by ideology and a desire to learn.
