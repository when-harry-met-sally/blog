I'm Miles. I'm a software engineer originally from Saint Louis, Missouri.
I moved to Chicago in August of 2024. 

My life consists of coding, coffee shops, and my cats (Dennis Hopper and Raspberry), movies, and travel.

This is the start of my tech blog. 
I did not get a formal education in Computer Science, but I see this field as my vocation.

There's tons to learn. I will document some of my curiosities here, because I think a blog can open up my learnings to scrutiny, which is a good thing. If I am misguided about some particular topic, I can be course corrected.

Anyways, this is amazing field and am grateful to be here.

My first entry will expand on these [[goals]].
